            <p>
                I am Lead Data Scientist at ILLUIN Technology, Paris. 
                We bridge the gap between applied research and industry business challenges. 
                We strive to understand, implement and put into production cutting-edge AI solutions in the Natural Language Processing field.
            </p>

            <p>
                Previously, I gained experience in the field of real time and distributed optimisation of energy systems working in collaboration with École Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne. 
                I have also co-founded a Deep Learning based Crypto-currency fund to develop new approaches of algorithmic trading.

                I graduated with a Master Degree in Mechanical Engineering from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne with a major in Control Systems and Optimisation and a minor in Energy. 
                I accomplished my Master Thesis at UC Berkeley in Deep Learning for curiosity driven agents.
