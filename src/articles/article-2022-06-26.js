            Today I am at the NFT NYC conference, the biggest conference this year on NFTs.
            As the market is turning bearish, tt's an opportunity to reflect on the fundamentals of the market.
            In the present articles I am trying to answer the following questions :
            - Where can you buy NFTs ? What are the most famous Platforms ? What are their rate takes ?
            - What can you buy ? How many collections are there, whatâ€™s their size , what are the most famous ones ?
            - Who is actually buying NFTs and how many of them ?
        </div>
    );
