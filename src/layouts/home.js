            <p>
                I'am currently building a Web3 project with the aim to solve data quality issues in the Data Science Landscape.
                On the one side, my past experience in Data Science and Data Engineering made me realize how important data quality is to successfuly apply AI in the real world.
                On the other side, it is back in 2016 that I heard for the first time the word blockchain and have since then closely watched in space mature.
                It is about time to make it work for real applications.

                Previously, I was Lead Data Sciencist at ILLUIN Technology, an AI start up based in Paris.
                What we do the very best at ILLUIN is deploying Machine Learning models for the real world.
                Apart from technical challenges, leading the data science team taught me important skills such as recruiting, business development and R&D Roadmap planing.

                Previously, I gained experience in the field of real time and distributed optimisation of energy systems working in collaboration with École Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne. 
                I have also co-founded a Deep Learning based Crypto-currency fund to develop new approaches of algorithmic trading.

                I graduated with a Master Degree in Mechanical Engineering from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne with a major in Control Systems and Optimisation and a minor in Energy Engineering.
                I accomplished my Master Thesis at UC Berkeley working on the implementation of Curiosity driven Agents applied to Autonomous Race Driving using Deep Learning.
                It is there that I got addicted in building in understanding Neural Networks, building them from scratch in C to make them work in Micro Controlers.
