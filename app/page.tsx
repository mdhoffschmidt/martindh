                I have co-founded and run Formativ as CTO in 2021 and 2022.
                Our mission was to source ESG data in a transparent, traceable and systematic way to provide the highest data quality to our clients.
                Previous to that, I was Lead Data Sciencist at Illuin Technology, an AI start up based in Paris who's goal is to bridge the research & development world with real industrial use cases.
                Finally, my first experience as an entrepreneur dates back to 2017 when, being still a student, I started building bots on crypto-currency exchanges.
                In droped out from my PhD program in Hydrogen Fuel Cell research and created a crypto market making company.

                I graduated with a Master Degree in Mechanical Engineering from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne with a major in Control Systems and Optimisation and a minor in Energy Engineering.
                I accomplished my Master Thesis at UC Berkeley working on the implementation of Curiosity driven Agents applied to Autonomous Race Driving.
                It is there that I dit my first steps in Deep Learning, building Neural Network from scratch in C to make them work inside microcontrollers.
